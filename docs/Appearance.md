# Appearance

The **Appearance** tab controls everything about how the dancer display looks — transitions, colors, background image, and fonts.

---

## Transition

![Appearance — transitions and colors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/main/docs/screenshots/appearance-transition-v190.png)

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Style** | How the display transitions between tracks. Options include *Fade Through Black*, *Cross-Fade*, and *Cut*. |
| **Duration** | Length of the transition in seconds (drag the slider). |

---

## Colors

Set the color of each element on the dancer display:

| Element | What it colors |
|---|---|
| **Background** | The solid background fill (used when no background image is set, or behind a semi-transparent image) |
| **Artist** | The large artist/orchestra name text |
| **Title** | The track title text |
| **Genre/label** | The smaller genre or record label line |
| **Year** | The recording year (e.g. 1952) |
| **Track counter** | The "Track X of X" text in the corner |
| **Singer** | The vocalist/singer line |

Click any color swatch to open the macOS color picker.

## Field Visibility

![Appearance — field visibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/main/docs/screenshots/appearance-fieldvisibility-v230.png)

Control which fields are shown — independently for dance tracks and for the cortina "Coming Up" preview. Each row has two toggles: **Dance** (shown while a tanda is playing) and **Cortina** (shown in the next-track preview during a cortina).

| Field | Dance default | Cortina default |
|---|---|---|
| **Genre** | On | On |
| **Artist** | On | On |
| **Year** | Off | Off |
| **Title** | On | Off |
| **Singer** | Off | Off |
| **Artwork** | Off | Off |

A second toggle — **Show next track during cortina** — hides or shows the entire "Coming Up" next-track preview section. When off, the cortina screen shows only the cortina label with no preview content at all.

## Album Artwork

![Appearance — album artwork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/main/docs/screenshots/appearance-artwork-v190.png)

Configure how album artwork appears on the dancer screen. Artwork visibility is controlled per context in **Field Visibility** above — these sliders only take effect when artwork is enabled for Dance or Cortina (or both).

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Opacity** | 0 % = invisible, 100 % = fully opaque |
| **Scale** | 1× = natural size; increase to fill more of the screen |
| **Horizontal offset** | Move the artwork left (negative) or right (positive) |
| **Vertical offset** | Move the artwork up (negative) or down (positive) |

Artwork is fetched automatically from the playing track for all three player sources — Music.app, Swinsian, and Embrace. It fades in and out in sync with track transitions using the same transition style and duration configured above. When no artwork is available the display falls back gracefully (nothing is shown in that layer).

## Background Image

![Appearance — background image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/main/docs/screenshots/appearance-background-v2-190.png)

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pick Image… / Change Image…** | Opens a file picker to select any image file (label changes to *Change Image…* once an image is loaded) |
| **Clear** | Removes the background image |
| **Opacity** | 0 % = fully transparent (solid background color shows), 100 % = fully opaque |
| **Scale** | Zoom the image in or out (1× = original size, higher = zoomed in) |
| **Horizontal** | Pan the image left or right |
| **Vertical** | Pan the image up or down |

Use Scale + Horizontal + Vertical to frame exactly the part of the image you want behind the text.

---

## Fonts

![Appearance — fonts and singer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/main/docs/screenshots/appearance-singer-v201.png)

Configure the typeface, size, and style for each text element:

| Column | What you set |
|---|---|
| Font name | Choose from installed system fonts |
| Size | Point size of the text |
| Up/Down arrows | Fine-tune the point size |
| **B** | Bold |
| *I* | Italic |

The rows are **Artist**, **Title**, **Genre**, **Year**, and **Singer**. Whether each field is shown on the dancer screen is controlled in **Field Visibility** above.

### Singer Source

A **Source** picker lets you choose where the singer name comes from:

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| **Comments** | Reads the track's Comment metadata field. Useful when you've tagged vocalist names into comments in your library. This is the default and matches the behaviour of earlier versions. |
| **Album Artist** | Reads the Album Artist metadata field. Useful when Album Artist holds the vocalist name (common in some tango library workflows). |

A **Singer** font row appears below the source picker so you can set the typeface, size, and style independently of the other text elements.

---

## Text Order

![Appearance — text order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/main/docs/screenshots/appearance-textorder-v220.png)

Control the vertical order in which text items appear on the dancer display. There are two independent orderings — one for dance tracks and one for the cortina "Coming Up" preview.

| Section | What it controls |
|---|---|
| **Dance Tracks** | Order of items on the main display while a tanda is playing |
| **Cortinas — Coming Up** | Order of items in the next-tanda preview shown during cortinas |

Each section lists the available items. Use the **↑** and **↓** chevron buttons on the right of each row to move items up or down. Changes take effect on the dancer display immediately.

**Dance Tracks** items: Genre, Artist, Year, Title, Singer (default order matches the original layout)

**Cortinas — Coming Up** items: Genre, Artist, Year, Singer — plus **Title** is available here too if you want to show the next track's title in the cortina preview (off by default)

## Saving your settings

- **Save** — updates the currently active profile with the new settings
- **Save as New Profile…** — creates a new named profile (see [Profiles](Profiles))

Changes take effect on the dancer display immediately.

# TangoDisplay

A native macOS menu-bar app that shows a clean, fullscreen dancer display on an external monitor at milongas. It polls Music.app every 2 seconds, automatically detects cortinas, and shows track info — artist, title, genre, and tanda position.

## Features

- **Live track display** — artist, title, genre/label, and track counter (e.g. Track 2 of 4) on the dancer screen
- **Cortina detection** — configurable allowlist (cortina genres) and denylist (dance genres) with partial matching; shows a "CORTINA" overlay automatically
- **Coming-up preview** — displays the next tanda's genre and artist before it starts
- **Multi-monitor support** — sends the presentation window to any connected display; move and toggle fullscreen from the control window
- **Appearance profiles** — built-in (Classic, Modern, High Contrast) and unlimited custom profiles with per-field colors, fonts, and background image
- **Background image** — any image with opacity, scale, and pan controls
- **Transitions** — configurable fade style and duration between tracks
- **Global hotkeys** — `⌘⇧O` override, `⌘⇧P` pause display, `⌘⇧R` force-refresh, without switching windows
- **Mirror mode** — live preview of the presentation window in the control window
- **Display labels** — customisable "CORTINA", "COMING UP", and idle message text
- **Idle message** — optional text shown when nothing is playing

## Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| macOS | 13 Ventura or later |
| Music.app | Must be running and playing from a playlist |
| Xcode Command Line Tools | `xcode-select --install` — no full Xcode needed |

---

## Installation

### Option A — Download pre-built app (easiest)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/releases) page
2. Download `TangoDisplay-v1.0.3.zip`
3. Unzip and drag `TangoDisplay.app` to your `/Applications` folder
4. **Right-click › Open** on first launch (required because the app is ad-hoc signed, not notarised)
5. Grant the permissions macOS requests (see [Permissions](#permissions) below)

### Option B — Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay.git
cd TangoDisplay

# Build, bundle, sign, and install to /Applications in one step
./Install.sh
```

`Install.sh` requires Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). It will:
- Regenerate the app icon
- Build a release binary with `swift build -c release`
- Assemble `TangoDisplay.app` with a correct `Info.plist`
- Ad-hoc code-sign the bundle
- Install to `/Applications` and launch the app

---

## Permissions

On first launch macOS will prompt for two permissions:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| **Automation › Music** | TangoDisplay reads the currently playing track, artist, genre, playlist position, and upcoming tracks via AppleScript |
| **Input Monitoring** | Required for the global hotkeys (`⌘⇧O`, `⌘⇧P`, `⌘⇧R`) to work while other apps are in focus. Grant in **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Input Monitoring** |

> Global hotkeys silently do nothing if Input Monitoring is denied — everything else works fine without it.

---

## Quick Start

1. Start Music.app and play a playlist
2. Launch TangoDisplay — a small display icon appears in the menu bar
3. Click the menu bar icon › **Show Settings Window**
4. Go to **Display** and select your external monitor as the target display
5. Click **Move Presentation Window** then **Toggle Fullscreen**
6. The dancer display is live — go to **Appearance** to customise colors, fonts, and background

See the **[Wiki](https://github.com/richardsladetdj-creator/TangoDisplay/wiki)** for a full user guide with screenshots.

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Debug build
swift build

# Run all tests (39 tests, custom runner — no Xcode needed)
swift run TangoDisplayTests

# Full release build → /Applications (same as install)
./Install.sh
```

---

## Architecture

The project has three SPM targets with no external dependencies:

| Target | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TangoDisplayCore` | Library | Pure logic — cortina detection, tanda tracking, models. No AppKit/SwiftUI. |
| `TangoDisplay` | Executable | SwiftUI app — UI, AppleScript bridge, polling, settings, window management |
| `TangoDisplayTests` | Executable | Lightweight custom test runner (`swift run TangoDisplayTests`) |

Key design decisions:
- `NSAppleScript` runs on a dedicated background serial queue (avoids blocking the main thread)
- Playlist lookahead is fetched on every cortina transition (for accurate "Coming Up" info) and also refreshed every 20 seconds (every 10th 2s poll)
- Profiles are stored as JSON in `~/Library/Application Support/TangoDisplay/profiles/`
- Colors are stored as hex strings in `AppearanceProfile` (Codable)
- `ObservableObject` + `@Published` throughout (macOS 13 target predates `@Observable`)

## Changelog

### v1.0.3
- **Fix:** Display labels ("CORTINA", "COMING UP", idle message) now update immediately on the presentation window when saved, instead of requiring a restart. Edited via the Display tab with a **Save** button and an unsaved-changes indicator.

### v1.0.2
- **Bug fix:** "Coming Up" next-tanda artist on the cortina screen now refreshes on every cortina transition instead of waiting up to 20 seconds. If the user switches playlists while a cortina is playing, the stale next-artist preview is cleared immediately when the fresh playlist data arrives, falling back to a plain "CORTINA" display.

### v1.0.1
- **Bug fix:** Clearing an override no longer inherits a user-pause that was active before the override was triggered. `isPausedByUser` and `pendingStateBeforePause` are now reset in `clearOverride()`.

### v1.0
- Initial release.
